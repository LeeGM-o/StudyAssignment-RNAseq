# RNA-seq pipeline
## Purpose
There are samples treated with various drugs. This analysis compares two samples to determine which genes are highly or lowly expressed in the sample treated with drug A, and which pathways are enriched in the genes.  
The results were obtained through a request from another laboratory, so the specific genes and pathways involved are not disclosed.  
The drugs used are as follows:
*  Drug A
*  Drug B
*  Drug C
*  Control
