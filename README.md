# RNA-seq pipeline
## Purpose
* There are samples treated with various drugs. This analysis compares two samples to determine which genes are highly or lowly expressed in the sample treated with **Drug A**, and which pathways are enriched in the genes.  
* Since this analysis was conducted at the request of another laboratory, the specific sample names, genes, and pathways will not be disclosed.
* The drugs used are as follows:
> 1. **Drug A**
> 2. Drug B
> 3. Drug C
> 4. Control
